## Who Will Become A  Millionaire Coder? 

**Project Database Setup**

This project involves setting up a MongoDB database for managing millionairecoder data. Below are the steps to set up the database along with useful resources:

**MongoDB Community Server Installation:**

To install MongoDB Community Server, please follow the instructions provided in the [MongoDB Community Server Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

**MongoDB Compass for GUI:**

For a graphical user interface to interact with MongoDB, you can use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

**Starting and Terminating MongoDB Server Process in Linux:**

To start the MongoDB server process, you can use the following command:
```
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```
To terminate the MongoDB server process, you can use the following command:
```
brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0
```

**Database and Collection Setup:**

After installing MongoDB and starting the server, follow these steps to create the required database and collection:

1. Open MongoDB Compass.
2. Create a database named "millionairecoder" and a collection named "players".

**Additional Notes:**

- Make sure MongoDB is running before attempting to connect to the database. Use the following command to check the process: `brew services list`.

**Project Setup Guide**

**Downloading Apache Tomcat Server:**

1. Visit the [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
2. Navigate to the "Download" section.
3. Select the latest version of Tomcat available.
4. Choose the appropriate distribution format (e.g., ZIP or TAR.GZ) based on your operating system.
5. Download the selected distribution file to your local machine.

**Setting up a Java Project in IntelliJ IDEA:**

To set up a Java project in IntelliJ IDEA using the provided Git URL to clone it, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA:**
   Launch IntelliJ IDEA on your computer.

2. **Clone the Git Repository:**
   In IntelliJ IDEA, go to the top menu and click on "VCS" (Version Control System), then select "Get from Version Control" > "Git".

3. **Enter Git Repository URL:**
   In the "URL" field, paste the provided Git URL: `https://github.com/jdobariya/millionairecoder.git`.

4. **Choose Directory:**
   Choose the directory where you want to clone the repository on your local machine.

5. **Clone the Repository:**
   Click on the "Clone" button to clone the repository.

6. **Open Cloned Project:**
   Once the repository is cloned, IntelliJ IDEA will ask if you want to open the project. Click on "Yes" to open the project.

7. **Set Up Java Project:**
   Since the project is already a Java project, you don't need to create a new one. Instead, IntelliJ IDEA will recognize the project structure and configurations.

8. **Build and Run:**
   You can now build and run the project in IntelliJ IDEA. Ensure that you have configured the project settings, such as SDK and dependencies, as needed.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and work with the Java project using IntelliJ IDEA, cloned from the provided Git URL.
